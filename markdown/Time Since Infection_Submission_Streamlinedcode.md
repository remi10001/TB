# This notebook contains the code to reproduce the main figures of the manuscript titled "_Blood RNA Signatures Predict Recent Tuberculosis Exposure in Mice, Macaques and Humans_"

Only Ingenuity Pathway Analysis for Figure 5E is excluded (commercial software)

It is recommended that jupyter extensions are used to allow easy display and review of the code:
    - https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
    
All code was run with access to a 128 GB RAM machine with 48 CPU cores. This amount of memory and CPU-cores is not necessary for all calculations, but may be necessary to some of the calls to the caret package (machine learning hyperparameter searches).
    
All code written during the development of this project is in "Time Since Infection RNA_Paper_Analysis.ipynb" and may be reviewed. However, it is not structured for easy, streamlined running of all code.

There are very small differences in p-values between Figures 2-4 (A,E only for Figure 4) herein compared to the original analysis reported in the paper, due the absence of setting a random seed before several random hyperparameter searches on training sets. The ultimate results are insensitive to these very small differences in random parameter settings.

### Conda environment (for both python and R packages)
 - Most of the python packages are not needed for this paper's analyses
 - The conda environment (including both python and R packages) is described in the env_list.txt and environment.yml files

## Figure 1 Mouse Analysis

- This code reproduces the analysis of Figure 1, showing that "Blood genome-wide RNA expression accurately discriminates early vs. late M.tb infection time periods in C57BL/6 mice"

    - For review, this code requires reviewer access for the accession number of this paper. To reproduce this analysis with these data, please download the SOFT file for the full family data from the accession page (Scope: Family; Format: SOFT; Amount: Full; GEO accession: GSE124688; click "GO") using the Reviewer access token.

    - Place this SOFT file in the data/GSE124688 folder and rename it "GSE124688_family.soft"

### Batch correct expression data by hybridization chamber and dataset as in Gideon et al. 2016


```R
modcombat<-model.matrix(~1, data=pheno)
combat_dataset= ComBat(dat=expres, batch=pheno$dataset, mod=modcombat, par.prior=TRUE, prior.plots=TRUE)
expres = ComBat(dat=combat_dataset, batch=pheno$hyb.chamber, mod=modcombat, par.prior=TRUE, prior.plots=TRUE)

### Statistically Filter the genes by 60% most variable genes


```R
cut = 0.6

filter = function(x) {IQR(x) / median(x)}
genes.range = apply(expres, 1, filter)
criteria = quantile(genes.range, c(1-cut))

genes.f = rownames(expres)[genes.range > criteria]
expres = expres[genes.f,]
```

### Focus on time points 20 - 180 days, and store a copy of the pheno table


```R
expres = expres[, pheno$time.point > 10]
pheno = pheno[pheno$time.point > 10,]
```


```R
pheno$time.period = as.factor(ifelse(pheno$time.point >= 90,

### Divide the data into a training and test set (70-30 split), with preserved ratio of monkeys with latent or active tuberculosis.

- This split was performed in python, which is located Macaque_analysis_train_test_set_split.ipynb


```R
test.latent.monkeys = c('M13', 'M27', 'M34', 'M15', 'M35', 'M36')
test.active.monkeys = c('M1', 'M16', 'M32', 'M18', 'M23')
```


```R
test.rows = rownames(pheno[pheno$monkeyid %in% union(test.latent.monkeys, test.active.monkeys),])
train.rows = setdiff(rownames(pheno), test.rows)

if (dim(expres)[1] > dim(expres)[2])
    expres = t(expres)

pheno.train = droplevels(pheno[train.rows,])
pheno.test = droplevels(pheno[test.rows,])
expres.train = expres[train.rows,]
expres.test = expres[test.rows,]
```

### Create grouped k-folds according to monkey within the training set. With random seed set to 100, this gives 9-folds


```R
set.seed(100)
folds = groupKFold(pheno.train$monkeyid, k=10)
for (fold in lapply(folds, function(x) {pheno.train$monkeyid[x]}))
    print(length((as.character(fold))))

lapply(folds, function(x, y) table(y[x]), y = pheno.train$monkeyid)
```

train.grid = data.frame(lambda = sample(lambda.grid, length(lambda.grid)),
                       alpha = sample(alpha.grid, length(lambda.grid)))
```


```R

### Reproduce Analysis for Figure 4A

#### Load and co-process the data from the ARCHS4 resource for GC6-74 and ACS

#### To download data from the ARCHS4 resource
 - In a web browser go to https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/archs4/data.html
 - Search for GSE94438 (GC6-74) and click the download link (a zipped folder with a gene_count.tsv file is downloaded)
 - Do the same for for GSE79362 (ACS) 
 - Move the respective files into their data/GSE... folder in this repository and rename: "gene_count_GSE[GSE # here].tsv"


```R
source("utils_submission.R")

Sul.path = paste(path, "/data/GSE94438", sep="")

### Reproduce Analysis for Figures 4B-D

- This requires the code from Figure 3 to have been run beforehand

#### Load and co-process the data from the ARCHS4 resource for GC6-74 and Singhania et al 2018

#### To download Singhania et al 2018 data from the ARCHS4 resource:
 - These data are more difficult to extract due to GSE107995 being a multi-series record and not available by direct quiery at  https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/archs4/data.html
 - We extracted these data from the entire gene expression table of the ARCHS4 resource:
     - Run download_ARCHS4_datatable.sh to download human_matrix.h5 v6 Date: 9/2018. Our analyses should be unchanged if the matrix is updated on the ARCHS4 website.
     - Run code in extract_ARCHS4_Singhania_etal.ipynb
 - The ARCHS4 data for GSE94438 (GC6-74) from Figure 4A are also required
